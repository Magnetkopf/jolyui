# Packages Directory

This directory is reserved for future npm packages.

## Structure

When you're ready to publish packages, create them here:

```
packages/
├── your-component/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   └── tsup.config.ts
└── another-component/
```

## Publishing

Packages will be published as `@jolyui/component-name` to npm.

See the main README for more information on creating and publishing packages.
