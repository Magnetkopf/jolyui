## Notes

- Uses motion/react for smooth character-by-character animations
- Each character animates with opacity, vertical movement, blur, and 3D rotation
- Staggered animation delays create a wave-like morphing effect
- Automatically cycles through texts at specified intervals
- Supports custom CSS classes for styling
- Maintains consistent width by using the longest text as reference
- Perfect for dynamic headlines, loading states, or eye-catching text effects
